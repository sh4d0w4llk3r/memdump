# memdump

Meterpreter memory dump 

This script was written by darckoperator in 2009 to work with mdd.exe. the mmd software is no longer compatible with windows 7/8/10.

The changes bring make this script compatible to windows 7/8/10 OS using the DumpIt.exe soft


## Required:
Have a Meterpreter session on the target.

Add the DumpIt.exe software to the directory
 
    /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/

add the memdump.rb script to the directory


    /usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/meterpreter
    
DumpIt.exe is available here https://my.comae.io/login

Disclamer : I am not the author of this script I only made it up to date with some modifications to make it compatible with the new OS Windows 7/8/10. The paternity of this script is all natural to darcoperator a monster whose github is here
